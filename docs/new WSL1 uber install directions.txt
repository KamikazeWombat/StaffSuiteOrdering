sudo apt install python3
git clone https://github.com/bitbyt3r/sideboard.git
cd sideboard
on my system I had to also run apt-get install python3-venv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
export SIDEBOARD_GITPLUGINS='[{"plugin_directory": "uber", "git_url": "https://github.com/bitbyt3r/ubersystem.git", "branch": "master"}]'

possibly need to install gcc? - already installed apparently? - had to run with sudo when retrying
got error saying need libcap development headers - sudo apt-get install build-essential libcap-dev
below commamd produced a number of errors, but this was also 3rd time running it on the same wsl ibstall so not sure if partial previous runs is why
python setup.py develop
possibly need pip install psycopg2-binary - need to install python3-pip first
python setup.py fetchplugins
sudo apt install redis
redis-server &
sudo apt install postgresql

psql # create reggie user and database with password reggie
sep reset_uber_db
python sideboard/run_server.py
# It should now be running on localhost:8282/reggie
