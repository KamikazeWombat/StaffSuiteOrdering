Question for the new food ordering system:
How would people like to notified that their Staff Suite carryout order is ready for pickup and they need to send a runner?
Currently planned integrations (pending time to make them work) are Slack, text and email.  

I haven't looked at Slack integration yet but from what I see on existing bots they are capable of posting in a channel or messaging someone directly.  @here or @channel for department? message in dept channel with @mentions for whoever wants notified? dm to whoever wants notified?

For all 3 forms of communication do people want to be able to specify notifications for the whole event, for each meal differently, or both?

Please let me know what you would prefer in thread, eventually probably all of these will be available options but I need to know which pieces to focus on first.
If you have other ideas for useful notification methods or if one method is not useful to your department at all please tell me that too. 
Thanks!
