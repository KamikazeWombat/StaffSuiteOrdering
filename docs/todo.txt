why am I passing it a list?

in meal_setup_list() update id field to something more specific

see if ID in meal_edit can be just changed to meal_id without errors

add note under allergies thing to please only put actual allergies, not preferences as we take allergies very seriously
and they are therefore extra work.

big warning if order not approved already


allergies = {'standard_labels': response['result']['food_restrictions']['standard_labels'],
                                 'freeform': response['result']['food_restrictions']['freeform']}

notes for after fest:
We can add more toggle options if that will help you

bigger notice for people if their order is not approved
